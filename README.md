# QuickScan: A student identification app for employing exisitng student ID cards for authentication in school events

QuickScan provides a simple solution for identifying students for event checkins and attendance records using existing smartphones, registries, and ID cards.


## Basics 

QuickScan offers a simple two screen interface for managing events.

`The landing screen` of the app has the user authenticate their `scanning session` with a unique identifier for their event; each event has a separate bucket for scanning-logs so that users can manage multiple events with from within the same interface while maintaining the organization of their data in the cloud. The scanning logs, `event-identifiers`, and metadata for each user are available through the `web-client` dashboard, which lends users access to all logs and events captured through the QuickScan app.

`The scanning interface` is a non-interactive page that automatically recognizes, scans, and uploads checkin-instances to the event bucket whenever an id-card passes the camera's view.

#Instructions:

Please clone the git repository for QuickScan, open the android project within the folder using Android Studio, and run the app on your mobile device. Feel free to distribute the APK and source at your convenience.
